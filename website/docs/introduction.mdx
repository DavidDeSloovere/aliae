It's not exactly rocket science, aliae allows you to create a unified alias experience across all your shell and devices.

##  Why did I make this?

I wanted to have a unified alias experience across all the shells I use when building/validating [Oh My Posh][omp].
It's the one feature that was missing when trying to build a seamless cross shell experience for tools you use every day.

## I want in!

Great, all you need is to install and configure aliae on your machine and you're good to go. Find the installation guide
for your platform and have a look at the alias [configuration][alias] page to get started.

[omp]: https://ohmyposh.dev
[alias]: configuration/alias
